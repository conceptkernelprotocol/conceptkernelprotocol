# Agentic Governance Lifecycle

CKP operationalizes governance for ontological concepts through a repeatable, agent-driven lifecycle. From proposal to consensus (and continual evolution) every stage is designed for transparency, trust, and adaptability.

## Theory

**Governance Steps:**
1. **Proposal & Discovery**: Agents (or participants) identify gaps or improvements and formally propose schema/concept changes.
2. **Validation & Alignment**: Peers semantically and logically review proposals, ensuring compatibility and coherence with existing definitions.  
3. **Consensus & Integration**: Community uses voting, reputation, or proof mechanisms to reach collective decision; results are logged.  
4. **Evolution & Refinement**: Adopted changes enter production; ongoing monitoring and proposals drive future iterations.

All actions are logged for auditability (see [agentic_concept_governance.py](../ingest_only_do_not_link/agentic_concept_governance.py)).

## Example Governance Cycle (Python-style)

```python
proposal = {"add_property": {"name": "confidence", "type": "float"}}
result = orchestrator.run_governance_cycle(proposal)
print(result)
```

This mirrors the methodology set out in the [CKP guide](../ingest_only_do_not_link/protocol-publication-guide.md):
- Initialization (readiness & negotiation)
- Operation (proposals, method calls, updates)
- Shutdown (deallocation, review)

**Why this lifecycle:**  
By enforcing clarity, repeatability, and feedback, CKP ensures both resilience and openness in semantic evolution.
