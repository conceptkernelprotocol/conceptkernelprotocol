# Protocol Lifecycle Phases

The CKP lifecycle makes possible the vibrant "lives" of billions of agents: from being spawned, to learning, connecting, working together, and—when their time or task is done—leaving insights for new generations. This supports both mechanical coordination and the social, reasoning, creative, and self-organizing potential of Concept Kernels.

## Theory

- **Negotiation/initialization:** Agents "meet," exchange abilities and knowledge, and get ready to collaborate.
- **Operation:** Agents work, reason, socialize, and organize—individually or in groups—to achieve common goals, share excitement, and entertain new scenarios.
- **Shutdown/termination:** Agents document what was learned, celebrate collective accomplishment, and gracefully make way for new or evolving kernels.

## Example

| Phase           | Description                                                   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialization  | Agents hear each other, negotiate roles, organize knowledge   |
| Operation       | Socialize, reason, collaborate, create, and connect           |
| Shutdown        | Document learnings, retire, inspire new kernels               |
