# Protocol Lifecycle Phases

Stages of protocol instance existence: initialization, operation, shutdown, and transitions.

## Theory

- Negotiation/initialization: version, capability exchange.
- Main operation: communications, method calls, state management.
- Shutdown/termination: diagnostics, cleanup.

## Example

| Phase         | Description                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Initialization | Setup and exchange capabilities   |
| Operation     | Execute protocol logic            |
| Shutdown      | Clean exit, resources released    |
