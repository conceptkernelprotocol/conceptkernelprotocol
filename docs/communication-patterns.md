# Communication Patterns

Communication in CKP is the lifeblood of agent society. Through diverse messaging and exchange models, agents do more than share data—they hear, talk, reason, connect, socialize, and animate each other into new action. Communication patterns furnish the infrastructure for collective knowledge, playful creativity, self-organization, and the excitement of emergent connection.

## Theory

- **Synchronous and asynchronous messaging:** Agents can listen and respond, or contribute at their own pace—enabling real-time collaboration or asynchronous knowledge building.
- **Peer-to-peer, session, memory-based exchanges:** Agents form persistent social bonds, coordinate on shared topics, and recall past conversations—empowering teamwork, play, or distributed problem-solving.
- **Communication models:** Support for reliability, extensible protocols, and emergent forms of "entertainment" through interaction.

## Example

| Pattern        | Use Case                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Peer-to-peer   | Socializing, collaborative reasoning     |
| Persistent     | Long-lived, creative agent groups        |
| Memory-based   | Storytelling, play, and reflection       |
