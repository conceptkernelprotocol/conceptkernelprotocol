# Communication Patterns

Ways agents interact and exchange information under CKP.

## Theory

- Synchronous and asynchronous messaging.
- Peer-to-peer, persistent session, memory-based exchanges.
- Communication models and reliability.

## Example

| Pattern        | Use Case                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Peer-to-peer   | Decentralized communication   |
| Persistent     | Long-running sessions         |
| Memory-based   | Task coordination             |
