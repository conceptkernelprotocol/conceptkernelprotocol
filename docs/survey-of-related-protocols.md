# Survey of Related Protocols

CKP emerges in a world where billions of agents are spawned daily—each potentially hearing, talking, working, and connecting. CKP is designed from the ground up for deep interoperability, working natively alongside protocols like AAP (Agent Activation Protocol) and MCP (Model Context Protocol). Concept Kernels and their agents can augment MCP agents with new "senses" (capabilities or behaviors), and extend or coordinate with AAP-based orchestration and lifecycle management.

## Theory

- Existing protocols: agent communication (FIPA-ACL), ontological frameworks, semantic web, and new activation/context protocols like AAP, MCP.
- CKP’s unique contributions: consensus-driven governance, role for agents to not only exchange messages but to organize, inspire, and collectively evolve—while offering paths to extend or augment MCP agents and plug into broader protocol ecosystems.

## Example

| Protocol            | Domain              | Key Differences                                          |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| FIPA-ACL            | Agent Comms        | CKP: Social, modular, self-governing kernels             |
| Schema.org          | Linked Data        | CKP: Agents reason, form consensus, evolve definitions   |
| MCP (Model Context) | Model Integration  | CKP: Extend MCP agents with new senses/skills            |
| AAP                 | Agent Activation   | CKP: Kernel-driven activation and experience             |
