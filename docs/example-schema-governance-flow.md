# Example Schema Governance Flow

Step-by-step illustration of schema governance and integration under CKP.

## Theory

- Discovery of need or proposal for schema change
- Validation and alignment with current design
- Consensus through voting/signals
- Evolution and refinement post-acceptance

## Example Flow

1. Agent proposes new schema property.
2. Agents validate for conflicts and completeness.
3. Votes are cast and result determined.
4. Accepted? Merged and logged; else revised.
