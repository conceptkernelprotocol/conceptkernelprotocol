# Governance & Trust Mechanisms

How CKP implements auditable, transparent, and trustworthy governance.

## Theory

- Consensus (voting, signals, proofs)
- Audit logs, transparency mechanisms
- Conflict resolution and compliance

## Example

| Mechanism  | Purpose                       |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Voting     | Agent consensus               |
| Logging    | Auditable proposals/actions   |
| Reputation | Delegated trust assignments   |
