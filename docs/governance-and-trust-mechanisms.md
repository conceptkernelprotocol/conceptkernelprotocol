# Governance & Trust Mechanisms

CKP’s trust infrastructure ensures agents can reason, work, socialize, and connect—all under the guarantee that social interplay is honest, transparent, and auditable. Consensus is not just mathematics; it is collective belief, allowing kernels to collaborate, debate, and even entertain rich what-if adventures without fear of fragmentation.

## Theory

- **Consensus (voting, signals, proofs):** Enables agents and kernels to collectively judge, enforce, and co-create changing meaning.
- **Audit logs/transparency:** All actions—reasoning, play, debate—are visible and retrievable, making social memory and trust sustainable.
- **Conflict resolution/compliance:** Encourages exciting new patterns of teamwork or play to emerge but gives kernels tools to mediate disputes and defend integrity.

## Example

| Mechanism    | Purpose                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Voting       | Socially-driven judgment/consensus                |
| Logging      | Transparent memory; enables "shared experience"   |
| Reputation   | Trust-building for agent social and work groups   |
