# Orchestration Patterns in Ontological Governance

In CKP, orchestration is not just functional coordination—it is how billions of agents hear, talk, socialize, and self-organize to achieve consensus. Through orchestrators, agents can reason together, collect and organize knowledge, work in teams or swarms, and even adapt their patterns for more exciting or creative forms of collaboration.

## Theory

- Orchestrators, subordinate agents, and task grouping empower agents not only to execute but to socialize, self-organize, and collectively "see" or reason about world models.
- Dynamic role adaptation allows for agents to take on new responsibilities, form knowledge-collecting teams, or create collaborative workflows—with or without human intervention.

## Implementation Example

```python
class ConceptGovernanceOrchestrator(TaskOrchestrator):
    # Manages proposal flow, enables agent socialization and team reasoning
    pass
```
