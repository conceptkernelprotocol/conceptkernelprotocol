# Orchestration Patterns in Ontological Governance

Patterns for coordinating agents, tasks, and dynamic workflows in CKP.

## Theory

- Orchestrators, subordinate agents, and task grouping.
- Dynamic adaptation of roles, workflow reconfiguration.

## Implementation Example

```python
class ConceptGovernanceOrchestrator(TaskOrchestrator):
    # Manages proposal flow and consensus
    pass
```

## Diagram (where needed)
