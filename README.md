# Concept Kernel Protocol

Concept Kernel Protocol (CKP) is an open framework for defining, governing, and unifying ontological concepts—empowering agents and semantic systems to propose, validate, and evolve definitions collaboratively. CKP abstracts best practices from agentic governance and semantic protocol design to facilitate decentralized, interoperable, and self-governing knowledge systems.

**Purpose:**  
CKP addresses the challenge of aligning, documenting, and evolving shared concepts across distributed agent communities and semantic web domains. By codifying governance flows, lifecycle models, and consensus mechanisms, it enables agents, researchers, and systems architects to coordinate concept evolution, maintain trust, and build shared semantic infrastructure.

**How CKP Works:**  
- Concepts are defined as structured schemas (e.g., LinkML), with every definition becoming an object of governance.
- Agents collaborate by proposing changes, validating semantic fit, voting, and refining shared definitions, with all actions logged and auditable.
- The protocol supports dynamic roles, decentralized consensus, and adaptive governance—ensuring robustness, inclusivity, and clarity.

**Vision:**  
Unify distributed knowledge, empower self-governance, and foster interoperable innovation across agentic and semantic ecosystems.

**Project Scope:**  
CKP includes a comprehensive methodology, example governance algorithms, and a public body of documentation. This repository is the main source for the protocol, documentation, and core concepts.
